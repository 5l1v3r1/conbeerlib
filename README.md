# conbeerlib

*conbeerlib* is an Android library for detecting if an Android app is running inside a virtual container. To learn more about virtual container, please check the presentation below. 

This is based on the work done by me and [Gautam](https://github.com/darvincisec), presented at [Android Security Symposium 2020](https://android.ins.jku.at/symposium/2020/program/gautam-arvind-pandian-and-vikas-gupta/) - [slides](android_virtual_container_slides.pdf).

*conbeerlib* library will be released soon, it requires some cleaning up of unused code and making it more usable.
